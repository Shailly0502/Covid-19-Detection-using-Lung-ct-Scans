# Covid-19-Detection-using-Lung-ct-Scans
The following repository is a covid 19 detection model using CNN model which predicts using 95% validation accurcy.
I have used a datagenerator to generate diffrent datasets from directories.
After extracting the datasets, I trained the dataset using a CNN model and a callback list consisting of "lronplateau" and "checkpoints".
The model produces results with 95% accuracy and can be used for prediction of test images.
You can get the datasets from the following link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/plameneduardo/sarscov2-ctscan-dataset
